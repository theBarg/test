    <h2>Foreword</h2>
    <p>Pale Fire, a poem in heroic couplets, of nine hundred ninety-nine lines,   divided into four cantos, was composed by John Francis Shade (born July 5, 1898,   died July 21, 1959) during the last twenty days of his life, at his residence in   New Wye, Appalachia, U.S.A. The manuscript, mostly Fair Copy, from which the   present text has been faithfully printed, consists of eighty medium-sized index   cards, on each of which Shade reserve the pink upper line for headings (canto   number, date) and used the fourteen light blue lines for writing out with a fine   nib in a minute, tidy, remarkably clear hand, the text of his poem, skipping a   line to indicate double-space, and always using a fresh card to begin a new   canto.</p>
<p>The short (166 lines) Canto One, with all those amusing birds and parhelia,   occupies thirteen cards. Canto Two, your favorite, and that shocking tour de   force, Canto Three, are identical in length (334 lines) and cover twenty-seven   cards each. Canto Four reverts to One in length and occupies again thirteen   cards, of which the last four used on the day of his death give a Corrected   Draft instead of a Fair Copy.</p>
<p>A methodical man, John Shade usually copied out his daily quota of completed   lines at midnight but even if he recopied them again later, as I suspect he   sometimes did, he marked his card or cards not with the date of his final   adjustments, but with that of his Corrected Draft or first Fair Copy. I mean, he   preserved the date of actual creation rather than that of second or third parts.   There is a very loud amusement park right in front of my present lodgings.</p>
<p>We possess in result a complete calendar of his work. Canto One was begun in   the small hours of July 2 and completed on July 4. He started the next canto on   his birthday and finished it on July 11. Another week was devoted to Canto   Three. Canto Four was begun on July 19, and as already noted, the last third of   its text (lines 949-999) is supplied by a Corrected Draft. This is extremely   rough in appearance, teeming with devastating erasures and cataclysmic   insertions, and does not follow the lines of the card as rigidly as the Fair   Copy does. Actually, it turns out to be beautifully accurate when you once make   the plunge and compel yourself to open your eyes in the limpid depths under its   confused surface. It contains not one gappy line, not one doubtful reading. This   fact would be sufficient to show that the imputations made (on July 24, 1959) in   a newspaper interview with one of our professed Shadeans--<em>who affirmed   without having seen the manuscript of the poem</em> that it &quot;consists of   disjointed drafts none of which yields a definite text&quot;--is a malicious   invention on the part of those who would wish not so much to deplore the state   in which a great poet's work was interrupted by death as to asperse the   competence, and perhaps honesty, of its present editor and commentator. </p>
<p>Another pronouncement made publicly by Prof. Hurley and his clique refers to   a structural matter. I quote from the same interview: &quot;None can say how long   John Shade planned his poem to be, but it is not improbable that what he left   represents only a small fraction of the composition he saw in a glass, darkly.&quot;   Nonsense again! Aside from the veritable clarion of internal evidence ringing   throughout Canto Four, there exists Sybil Shade's affirmation (in a document   dated July 25, 1959) that her husband &quot;never intended to go beyond four parts.&quot;   For him the third canto was the penultimate one, and thus I myself have heard   him speak of it, in the course of a sunset ramble, when, as if thinking aloud,   he reviewed the day's work and gesticulated in pardonable self-approbation while   his discreet companion kept trying in vain to adapt the swing of a long-limbed   gait to the disheveled poet's jerky shuffle. Nay, I shall even assert (as our   shadows still walk without us) that there reamined to be written only <em>one</em> line of the poem (namely verse 1000) which would have been   identical to <a href="Canto One.html" style="color:blue">line 1</a> and would have completed the symmetry of the structure, with   its two identical central parts, solid and ample, forming together with the   shorter flanks twin wings of five hundred verses each, and damn that music.   <a name="foreword2" id="foreword2"></a>Knowing Shade's combinatorial turn of mind and subtle sense of harmonic balance,   I cannot imagine that he intended to deform the faces of his crystal by meddling   with its predictable growth. And if all this were not enough--and it is, it is   enough--I have had the dramatic occasion of hearing my poor friend's own voice   proclaim on the evening of July 21 the end, or almost the end, of his labors.   <a href="Line991.html" style="color:purple">(See my note to line 991.)</a></p>
<p>This batch of eighty cards was held by a rubber band which I now religiously   put back after examining for the last time their precious contents. Another,   much thinner, set of a dozen cards, clipped together and enclosed in the same   manila envelope as the main batch, bears some additional couplets running their   brief and sometimes smudgy course among a chaos of first drafts. As a rule,   Shade destroyed drafts the moment he ceased to need them: well do I recall   seeing him from my porch, on a brilliant morning, burning a whole stack of them   in the pale fire of the incinerator before which he stood with bent head like an   official mourner among the wind-borne black butterflies of that backyard   auto-da-fe. But he saved those twelve cards because of the unused felicities   shining among the dross of used draftings. Perhaps, he vaguely expected to   replace certain passages in the Fair Copy with some of the lovely rejections in   his files, or, more probably, a sneaking fondness for this or that vignette,   suppressed out of architectonic considerations or because it had annoyed Mrs.   S., used him to put off its disposal till the time when the marble finality of   an immaculate typescript would have confirmed it or made the most delighteful   variant seem cumbersome and impure. And perhaps, let me add in all modesty, he   intended to ask me advice after reading his poem to me as I know he planned to   do.</p>
<p>In my notes to the poem the reader will find these canceled readings. Their   places are indicated, or at least suggested, by the draftings of established   lines in their immediate neighborhood. In a sense, many of them are more   valuable artistically and historically than some of the best passages in the   final text. I must now explain how <em>Pale Fire</em> came to be edited by me. </p>
<p>Immediately after my dear friend's death I prevailed on his distraught widow   to forelay and defeat the commercial passions and academic intrigues that were   bound to come swirling around her husband's manuscript (transferred by me to a   safe spot even before his body had reached the grave) by signing an agreement to   the effect that he had turned over the manuscript to me; that I would have it   published without delay, with my commentary, by a firm of my choice; that all   profits, except the publisher's percentage, would accrue to her; and that on   publication day the manuscript would be handed over the Library of Congress for   permanent preservation. I defy any serious critic to find this contract unfair.   Nevertheless, it has been called (by Shade's former lawyer) a &quot;fantastic farrago   of evil,&quot; while another person (his former literary agent) has wondered with a   sneer if Mrs. Shade's tremulous signature might not have been penned &quot;in some   peculiar kind of red ink.&quot; Such hearts, such brains, would be unable to   comprehend that one's attachment to a masterpiece may be utterly overwhelming,   especially when it is the underside of the weave that entrances the beholder and   only begetter, whose won past intercoils there with the fate of the innocent   author.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I think, in my last note to the poem, the depth charge of   Shade's death blasted such secrets and caused so many dead fish to float up,   that I was forced to leave New Wye soon after my last interview with the jailed   killer The writing of the commentary had to be postponed until I could find a   new incognito in quieter surroundings, but practical matters concerning the poem   had to be settled at once. I took a plane to New York, had the manuscript   photographed, came to terms with one of Shade's publishers, and was on the point   of clinching the deal when, quite casually, in the midst of a vast sunset (we   sat in a cell of walnut and glass fifty stories above the progression of   scarabs), my interlocutor observed: &quot;You'll be happy to know, Dr. Kinbote, that   Professor So-and-so [one of the members of the Shade committee] has consented to   act as our adviser in editing the stuff.&quot;</p>
<p>Now &quot;happy&quot; is something extremely subjective. One of our sillier Zemblan   proverbs says: <em>the lost glove is happy</em>. Promptly I refastened the catch   of my briefcase and betook myself to another publisher.</p>
<p>Imagine a soft, clumsy giant; imagine a historical personage whose knowledge   of money is limited to the abstract billions of a national debt; imagine an   exiled prince who is unaware of the Golconda in his cuff links! This is to   say--oh, hyperbolically--that I am the most impractical fellow in the world.   Between such a person and an old fox in the book publishing business, relations   are at first touchingly carefree and chummy, with expansive banterings and all   sorts of amiable tokens. I have no reason to suppose that anything will ever   happen to prevent this initial relationship with good old Frank, my present   publishers, from remaining a permanent fixture.</p>
<p>Frank has acknowledged the safe return of the galleys I had been sent here   and has asked me to mention in my Preface--and this I willingly do--that I alone   am responsible for any mistakes in my commentary. Insert before a professional.   A professional proofreader has carefully rechecked the printed text of the poem   against the phototype of the manuscript, and has found a few trivial misprints I   had missed; that has been all in the way of outside assistance. Needless to say   how much I had been looking forward to Sybil Shade's providing me with abundant   biographical data; unfortunately she left New Wye even before I did, and is   dwelling now with relatives in Quebec. We might have had, of course, a most   fruitful correspondence, but the Shadeans were not to be shaken off. They headed   for Canada in droves to pounce on the poor lady as soon as I had lost contact   with her and her changeful moods. Instead of answering a month-old letter from   my cave in Cedarn, listing some of my most desperate queries, such as the real   name of &quot;Jim Coates,&quot; etc., she suddenly shot me a wire, requesting me to accept   Prof. H. (!) and Prof. C. (!!) as co-editors of her husband's poem. How deeply   this surprised and pained me! Naturally, it precluded collaboration with my   friend's misguided widow.</p>
<p>And he was a very dear friend indeed! The calendar says I had known him only   for a few months but there exist friendships which develope their own inner   duration, their own eons of transparent time, independent of rotating, malicious   music. Never shall I forget how elated I was upon learning, as mentioned in a   note my read shall find, that the suburban house (rented for my use from Judge   Goldsworth who had gone on his Sabbatical to England) into which I moved on   February 5, 1959, stood next to that of the celebrated American poet whose   verses I had tried to put into Zemblan two decades earlier! Apart from this   glamorous neighborhood, the Goldsworthian chateau, as I was soon to discover,   had little to recommend it. The heating system was a farce, depending as it did   on registers in the floor wherefrom the tepid exhalations of a throbbing and   groaning basement furnace were transmitted to the rooms with the faintness of a   moribund's last breath. By occluding the apertures upstairs I attempted to give   more energy to the register in the living room but its climate proved to be   incurably vitiated by there being nothing between it and the arctic regions save   a sleezy front door without a vestige of vestibule--either because the house had   been built in mid-summer by a naive settler who could not imagine the kind of   winter New Wye had in store for him, or because old-time gentility required that   a chance caller at the open door could satisfy himself from the threshold that   nothing unseemly was going on in the parlor.</p>
<p>February and March in Zembla (the two last of the four &quot;white-nosed months,&quot;   as we call them) used to be pretty rough, too, but even a peasant's room there   presented a solid of uniform warmth--not a reticulation of deadly drafts. It is   true that, as usually happens to newcomers, I was told I had chosen the worst   winter in years--and this at the latitude of Palermo. On one of my first   mornings there, as I was preparing to leave for college in the powerful red car   I had just acquired, I noticed that Mr. and Mrs. Shade, neither of whom I had   yet met socially (I was to learn later that they assumed I wished to be left   alone), were having trouble with their old Packard in the slippery driveway   where it emitted whines of agony but could not extricate one tortured rear wheel   out of a concave inferno of ice. John Shade busied himself clumsily with a   bucket from which, with the gestures of a sower, he distributed handful of brown   sand over the blue glaze. He wore snowboots, his vicuna collar was up, his   abundant gray hair looked berimed in the sun. I knew he had been ill a few   months before, and thinking to offer my neighbors a ride to the campus in my   powerful machine, I hurried out toward them. A lane curving around the slight   eminence on which my rented castle stood separated it from my neighbors'   driveway, and I was about to cross that lane when I lost my footing and sat down   on the surprisingly hard snow. My fall acted as a chemical reagent on the   Shades' sedan, which forthwith budged and almost ran over me as it swung into   the lane with John at the wheel strenuously grimacing and Sybil fiercely talking   to him. I am not sure either saw me.</p>
<p>A few days later, however, namely on Monday, February 16, I was introduced to   the old poet at lunch time in the faculty club. &quot;At last presented credentials,&quot;   as noted, a little ironically, in my agenda. I was invited to join him and four   or five other eminent professors at his usual table, under an enlarged   photograph of Wordsmith College as it was, stunned and shabby, on a remarkably   gloomy summer day in 1903. His laconic suggestions that I &quot;try the pork&quot; amused   me. I am a strict vegetarian, and I like to cook my own meals. Consuming   something that had been handled by a fellow creature was, I explained to the   rubicund convives, as repulsive to me as eating any creature, and that would   include--lowering my voice--the pulpous pony-tailed girl student who served us   and licked her pencil. Moreover, I had already finished the fruit brought with   me in my briefcase, so I would content myself, I said, with a bottle of good   college ale. My free and simple demeanor set everybody at ease. The usual   questions were fired at me about eggnogs and milkshakes being or not being   acceptable to one of my persuasion. Shade said that with him it was the other   way around: he must make a definite effort to partake of a vegetable. Beginning   a salad, was to him like stepping into sea water on a chilly day, and he had   always to brace himself in order to attack the fortress of an apple. I was not   yet used to the rather fatiguing jesting and teasing that goes on among American   intellectuals of the inbreeding academic type and so abstained from telling John   Shade in front of all those grinning old males how much I admired his work lest   a serious discussion of literature degenerate into mere facetiation. Instead I   asked him about one of my newly acquired students who also attended his course,   a moody, delicate, rather wonderful boy; but with a resolute shake of his hoary   forelock the old poet answered that he had ceased long ago to memorize faces and   names of students and that the only person in his poetry class whom he could   visualize was an extramural lady on crutches. &quot;Come, come,&quot; said Professor   Hurley, &quot;do you mean, John, you really don't have a mental or visceral picture   of that stunning blonde in the black leotard who haunts Lit. 202?&quot; Shade, all   his wrinkles beaming, benignly tapped Hurley on the wrist to make him stop.   Another tormentor inquired if it was true that I had installed two ping-pong   tables in my basement. I asked, was it a crime? No, he said, but why two? &quot;Is <em>that</em> a crime?&quot; I countered, and they all laughed.</p>
<p>Despite a wobbly heart (<a href="Canto Three.html#735" style="color:blue">see line 735</a>), a slight limp, and a certain curious   contortion in his method of progress, Shade had an inordinate liking for long   walks, but the snow bothered him, and he preferred, in winter, to have his wife   call for him after classes with the car. A few days later, as I was about to   leave Parthenocissus Hall--or Main Hall (or now Shade Hall, alas), I saw him   waiting outside for Mrs. Shade to fetch him. I stood beside him for a minute, on   the steps of the pillared porch, while pulling my gloves on, finger by finger,   and looking away, as if waiting to review a regiment: &quot;That was a thorough job,&quot;   commented the poet. He consulted his wrist watch. A snowflake settled upon it.   &quot;Crystal to crystal,&quot; said Shade. I offered to take him home in my powerful   Kramler. &quot;Wives, Mr. Shade, are forgetful.&quot; He cocked his shaggy head to look at   the library clock. Across the bleak expanse of snow-covered turf two radiant   lads in colorful winter clothes passed, laughing and sliding. Shade glanced at   his watch again, and, with a shrug, accepted my offer.</p>
<p>I wanted to know if he did not mind being taken the longer way, with a stop   at the Community Center where I wanted to buy some chocolate-coated cookies and   a little caviar. He said it was fine with him. From the inside of the   supermarket, through a plate-glass window, I saw the old chap pop into a liquor   store. When I returned with my purchases, he was back in the car, reading a   tabloid newspaper which I had thought no poet would deign to touch. A   comfortable burp told me he had a flask of brandy concealed about his warmly   coated person. As we turned into the driveway of his house, we saw Sybil pulling   up in front of it. I got out with courteous vivacity. She said: &quot;Since my   husband does not believe in introducing people, let us do it ourselves: You are   Dr. Kinbote, aren't you? And I am Sybil Shade.&quot; Then she addressed her husband   saying he might have waited in his office another minute: she had honked and   called, and walked all the way up, et cetera. I turned to go, not wishing to   listen to a marital scene, but she called me back: &quot;Have a drink with us,&quot; she   said, &quot;or rather with me, because John is forbidden to touch alcohol.&quot; I   explained I could not stay long because I was about to have a kind of little   seminar at home followed by some table tennis, with two charming identical twins   and another boy, another boy.</p>
<p>Henceforth I began seeing more and more of my celebrated neighbor. The view   from one of my windows kept providing me with first-rate entertainment,   especially when I was on the wait for some tardy guest. From the second story of   my house the Shades' living-room window remained clearly visible so long as the   branches of the deciduous trees between us were still bare, and almost every   evening I could see the poet's slippered foot gently rocking. One inferred from   it that he was sitting with a book in a low chair but one never managed to   glimpse more than that foot and its shadow moving up and down to the secret   rhythm of mental absorption, in the concentrated lamplight. Always at the same   time the brown morocco slipper would drop from the wool-socked foot which   continued to oscillate, with, however, a slight slackening of pace. One knew   that bedtime was closing in with all its terrors; that in a few minutes the toe   would prod and worry the slipper, and then disappear with it from my golden   field of vision traversed by the black bendlet of a branch. And sometimes Sybil   Shade would trip by with the velocity and swinging arms of one flouncing in and   out in a fit of temper, and would return a little later, at a much slower gait,   having, as it were, pardoned her husband for his friendship with an eccentric   neighbor; but the riddle of her behavior was entirely solved one night when by   dialing their number and watching their window at the same time I magically   induced her to go through the hasty and quite innocent motions that had puzzled   me.</p>
<p>Alas, my peace of mind was soon to be shattered. The thick venom of envy   began squirting at me as soon as academic suburbia realized that John Shade   valued my society above that of all other people. Your snicker, my dear Mrs. C.,   did not escape our notice as I was helping the tired old poet to find his   galoshes after that dready get-together party at your house. One day I happened   to enter the English Literature office in quest of a magazine with the picture   of the Royal Palace in Onhava, which I wanted my friend to see, when I overheard   a young instructor in a green velvet jacket, whom I shall mercifully call Gerald   Emerald, carelessly saying in answer to something the secretary had asked: &quot;I   guess My Shade has already left with the great beaver.&quot; Of course, I am quite   tall, and my brown beard is of a rather rich tint and texture; the silly   cognomen evidently applied to me, but was not worth noticing, and after calmly   taking the magazine from a pamphlet-cluttered table, I contented myself on my   way out with pulling Gerald Emerald's bow-tie loose with a deft jerk of my   fingers as I passed by him. There was also the morning when Dr. Nattochdag, head   of the department to which I was attached, begged me in a formal voice to be   seated, then closed the door, and having regained, with a downcast frown, his   swivel chair, urged me &quot;to be more careful.&quot; In what sense, careful? A boy had   complained to his adviser. Complained of what, good Lord? That I had criticized   a literature course he attended (&quot;a ridiculous survey of ridiculous works,   conducted by a ridiculous mediocrity&quot;). Laughing in sheer relief, I embraced my   good Netochka, telling him I would never be naughty again. I take this   opportunity to salute him. He always behaved with such exquisite courtesy toward   me that I sometimes wondered if he did not suspect what Shade suspected, and   what only three people (two trustees and the president of the college)   definitely knew.</p>
<p>Oh, there were many such incidents. In a skit performed by a group of drama   students I was pictured as a pompous woman hater with a German accent,   constantly quoting Housman and nibbling raw carrots; and a week before Shade's   death, a certain ferocious lady at whose club I had refused to speak on the   subject of &quot;The Hally Vally&quot; (as she put it, confusing Odin's Hall with the   title of a Finnish epic, said to me in the middle of a grocery store, &quot;You are a   remarkably disagreeable person. I fail to see how John and Sybil can stand you,&quot;   and, exasperated by my polite smile, she added: &quot;What's more, you are   insane.&quot;</p>
<p>But let me not pursue the tabulation of nonsense. Whatever was thought,   whatever was said, I had my full reward in John's friendship. This friendship   was the more precious for its tenderness being intentionally concealed,   especially when we were not alone, by that gruffness which stems from what can   be termed the dignity of the heart. His whole being constituted a mask. John   Shade's physical appearance was so little in keeping with the harmonies hiving   in the man, that one felt inclined to dismiss it as coarse disguise or passing   fashion; for if the fashions of the Romantic Age subtilized a poet's manliness   by baring his attractive neck, pruning his profile and reflecting a mountain   lake in his oval gaze, present-day bards, owing perhaps to better opportunities   of aging, look like gorillas or vultures. My sublime neigbor's face had   something about it that might have appealed to the eye, had it been only leonine   or only Iroquoian; but unfortunately, by combining the two it merely reminded   one of a fleshy Hogarthian tippler of indeterminate sex. His misshapen body,   that grap mop of abundant hair, the yellow nails of his pudgy fingers, the bags   under his lusterless eyes, were only intelligible if regarded as the waste   products eliminated from his intrinsic self by the same forces of perfection   which purified and chiseled his verse. He was his own cancellation.</p>
<p>I have one favorite photograph of him. In this color snapshot taken by a   onetime friend of mine, on a brilliant spring day, Shade is seen leaning on a   sturdy cane that had belonged to his aunt Maud (see line 86). I am wearing a   white windbreaker acquired in a local sports shop and a pair of lilac slacks   hailing from Cannes. My left hand is half raised--not to pat Shade on the   shoulder as seems to be the intention, but to remove my sunglasses which,   however, it never reached in <em>that</em> life, the life of the picture; and   the library book under my right arm is a treatise on certain Zemblan   calisthenics in which I proposed to interest that young roomer of mine who   snapped the picture. A week later he was to betray my trust by taking sordid   advantage of my absence on a trip to Washington whence I returned to find that   he had been entertaining a fiery-haired whore from Exton who had left her   combings and reek in all three bathrooms. Naturally, we separated at once, and   through a chink in the window curtains I saw bad Bob standing rather   pathetically, with his crewcut, and shabby valise, and the skis I had given him,   all forlorn on the roadside, waiting for a fellow student to drive him away   forever. I can forgive everything save treason.</p>
<p>We never discussed, John Shade and I, any of my personal misfortunes. Our   close friendship was on that higher, exclusively intellectual level where one   can rest from emotional troubles, not share them. My admiration for him was for   me a sort of alpine cure. I experienced a grand sense of wonder whenever I   looked at him, especially in the presence of other people, inferior people. This   wonder was enhanced by my awareness of their not feeling what I felt, of their   not seeing what I saw, of their taking Shade for granted, instead of drenching   every nerve, so to speak, in the romance of his presence. Here he is, I would   say to myself, that is his head, containing a brain of a different brand than   that of the synthetic jellies preserved in the skulls around him. He is looking   from the terrace (of Prof. C.'s house on that March evening) at the distant   lake. I am looking at him. I am witnessing a unique physiological phenomenon:   <a name="foreword3" id="foreword3"></a>John Shade perceiving and transforming the world, taking it in and taking it   apart, re-combining its elements in the very process of storing them up so as to   produce at some unspecified date an organic miracle, a fusion of image and   music, a line of verse. And I experienced the same thrill as when in my early   boyhood I once watched across the tea table in my uncle's castle a conjurer who   had just given a fantastic performance and was now quietly consuming a vanilla   ice. I stared at his powdered cheeks, at the magical flower in his buttonhole   where it had passed through a succession of different colors and had now become   fixed as a white carnation, and especially at his marvelous fluid-looking   fingers which could if he chose make his plate into a dove by tossing up in the   air.</p>
<p>Shade's poem is, indeed, that sudden flourish of magic: my gray-haired   friend, my beloved old conjurer, put a pack of index cards into his hat--and   shook out a poem.</p>
<p>To this poem we now must turn. My Foreword has been, I trust, not too skimpy.   Other notes, arranged in a running commentary, will certainly satisfy the most   voracious reader. Although those notes, in conformity with custom, come after   the poem, the reader is advised to consult them first and then study the poem   with their help, rereading them of course as he goes through its text, and   perhaps, after having done with the poem, consulting them a third time so as to   complete the picture. <a name="foreword1" id="foreword1"></a>I find it wise in such cases as this to eliminate the   bother of back-and-forth leafings by either cutting out and clipping together   the pages with the text of the thing, or, even more simply, purchasing two   copies of the same work which can then be placed in adjacent positions on a   comfortable table--not like the shaky little affair on which my typewriter is   precariously enthroned now, in this wretched motor lodge, with that carousel   inside and outside my head, miles away from New Wye. Let me state that without   my notes Shade's text simply has no human reality at all since the human reality   of such a poem as his (being too skittish and reticent for an autobiographical   work), with the omission of many pithy lines carelessly rejected by him, has to   depend entirely on the reality of its author and his surroundings, attachments   and so forth, a reality that only my notes can provide. To this statement my   dear poet would probably not have subscribed, but, <a id="bad justification"></a>for better or worse, it is   the commentator who has the last word.</p>
